# FastAPI Starter Kit 🚀

A lightweight, ready-to-use template for building APIs with **FastAPI**. Get started in minutes without the hassle of complex setup!

## Why Use This Starter Kit?

This template is designed to streamline your FastAPI development by eliminating:

- 🛠️ **Database configuration**
- ⚙️ **Environment setup**
- 📂 **Tedious project initialization and structure**
- 🗂️ **Manual setup of SQLAlchemy models and Pydantic schemas**

### Features

- ✅ **Type safety** with [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) support
- 🧹 **Code quality** ensured by [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) linter and formatter
- 📦 **Dependency management** via [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- 🐳 **Dockerized Postgres** for quick database setup
- 🔄 **Alembic migrations** for seamless database schema management

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.12+
- 📦 [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for Postgres setup)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Using HTTPS:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eugeneliukindev/fastapi-base-application.git
   ```

   Using SSH (recommended):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:eugeneliukindev/fastapi-base-application.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for details.

   *Optional*: Configure Poetry to create a virtual environment in the project root:
   ```bash
   poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
   ```

   Install dependencies:

   With dev dependencies (for development):
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   Without dev dependencies (for production):
   ```bash
   poetry install --without dev
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**

   Use the provided Docker Compose file to spin up a Postgres database:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   *Note*: Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed and running.

4. **Run Alembic Migrations**

   Generate and apply database migrations using Alembic:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create tables" && alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the Application**

   Navigate to the app directory and run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   cd fastapi-app && python main.py
   ```

   Your API is now running! Access it at `http://localhost:8000` (or the configured port).

## Usage

- 📚 **API Documentation**: Auto-generated by FastAPI at `/docs` (Swagger UI) or `/redoc`
- 🛠️ **Development Tools**:
  - Run `mypy .` for type checking
  - Run `ruff check .` for linting
  - Run `ruff format .` for code formatting
